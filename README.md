# belly-button-challenge

This visualization shows the data gathered in 2012 by Hulcr, J. et al. from sampling navels in 2012 and 2014 which was published by the Department of Applied Ecology of North Carolina State University website [The Public Science Lab](https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) and now cleaned data is stored in [a link](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json) for educational purposes. The Applied Ecology Department release the data publicly because they wanted to predict the type of bacteria in each individual by it demography but were unsuccessful, and now they are challenging the data science community to achieve this.  

This visualization contains 5 main elements in HTML:
  1) A banner or title.
  2) A selection dropdown manu with the list of sample ID.
  3) A panel with the data of the demographic info of sample taken from.
  4) A bar chart with the top 10 bacteria (described as OTU) in each sample by amount.
  5) A bubble chart with the visualization of all type of bacteria in a sample coding the size for the amount of bacteria, the color for the OTU.
